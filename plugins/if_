IMPORTANT: Since the data source for this plugin use 32bit counters, this plugin is really unreliable and unsuitable for most 100Mb (or faster) interfaces, where bursts are expected to exceed 50Mbps. This means that this plugin is usuitable for most production environments. To avoid this problem, use the ip_ plugin instead."
